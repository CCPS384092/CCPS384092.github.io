      <h1>About Me</h1>
      <p>
        In my personal life I am working towards bettering myself And by that I mean becoming more sociable, having a positive mindset and thinking ahead of myself planning
for my future goals.I am looking toward graduating school and becoming an entrepreneur and possibly start a clothing brand while studying to become a nurse or something
else. My mom was a nurse in Mexico and she always talked about how she loved her job and It was the only thing she was determined to do and then she moved here for a 
better opportunity but she didn’t know English so finding a job for her wasn’t the easiest and it was already too late for her to become a nurse again. So now I am
interested into becoming a nurse and continue her career to make her proud. My parents were always consistently asking me If I know what I want to study after graduating
and I guess that just stuck with me to wanting a bright future. I want to do my research on nursing and potentially apply to nursing programs. Having a correct mindset
and knowing what I want, being responsible for my own problems and not letting them get in the way , and being consistent into all that I do are my most necessary values for
my success. I hope to accomplish not stressing and like I said being responsible for my own problems. A character trait and achievement I want to be know for is being
independent and becoming the next successful nurse.
